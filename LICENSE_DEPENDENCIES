About Kiwi
----------
Chris Colbert began the Kiwi project in December 2013 in an effort to
create a blisteringly fast UI constraint solver. Chris is still the
project lead.

The Nucleic Development Team is the set of all contributors to the Nucleic
project and its subprojects.

The core team that coordinates development on GitHub can be found here:

Our Copyright Policy
--------------------
Nucleic uses a shared copyright model. Each contributor maintains copyright
over their contributions to Nucleic. But, it is important to note that these
contributions are typically only changes to the repositories. Thus, the Nucleic
source code, in its entirety is not the copyright of any single person or
institution. Instead, it is the collective copyright of the entire Nucleic
Development Team. If individual contributors want to maintain a record of what
changes/contributions they have specific copyright on, they should indicate
their copyright in the commit message of the change, when they commit the
change to one of the Nucleic repositories.

With this in mind, the following banner should be used in any source code file
to indicate the copyright and license terms:
